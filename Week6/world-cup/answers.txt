Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The less simulation we use, the incorrect predition is.
So predictions with less than 50 simulations are incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
The simultaion seems to stabalize after 80 simulations.
Knowing that the performance are similar to 100 simulation, we should do 100 simulation to have a good enough prediction.
